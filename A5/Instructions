Use the Builder design pattern to create 2 classes: AggressiveWarrior and DefensiveWarrior.

Warriors have 3 attributes, all integers (int): level, attack, and defense. Level is required, while attack
and defense are optional.

Aggressive warriors have a default attack of 3 and a default defense of 2.

Defensive warriors have a default attack of 2 and a default defense of 3.

The order of things matters in your class:
      Fields
      Constructor
      Methods
      Builder
          Builder Fields
          Builder Constructor
          Bulder methods
          Builder build()
          
Using default visibility is fine where private does not seem to fit. Always try private first, then increase
visibility as needed.

Validation: negative values for level, attack, and defense are all invalid. There are tests for this.
